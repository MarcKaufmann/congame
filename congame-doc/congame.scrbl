Congame is a platform for designing and deploying web-based research studies, and is @emph{the best
experimental economics software written in Racket}. 

Once deployed, a Congame @tech{study} becomes a web application. Using their browsers, people can
enroll in the study and participate by walking through each of the studyâ€™s steps, providing
responses to questions and even interacting in controlled ways with other participants. Congame
collects the responses and provides the data to each study author for further analysis.

Congame includes:

@itemlist[
    @item{Server applications and libraries for hosting @tech{studies} (the main @racketmodname[congame]
    collection)}

    @item{@tech{Conscript}, a scripting environment for prototyping studies.
    Using Conscript, you can develop studies rapidly on your local computer, without having to stand
    up a complete Congame server environment. When ready, a Conscript study can be uploaded to a Congame
    server.}
