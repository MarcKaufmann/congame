# Documentation tasks

Current priorities, in time/importance order:

## Add tutorial using `proposal-choice` example study

## Multi-participant parent/child studies

A new tutorial written around a multi-participant study that uses parent/child
studies. This would provide an opportunity to test/improve how the newly added
matchmaking functions work in the presence of parent/child studies.

## Misc reference additions

* Document `current-step-timings`. Exposed in `conscript/base` as
  `get-step-timings`.

* Document `dyn:form`

* Document new additions to `form0`:

    * `at-least`
    * `input-file`
    * `list-longer-than`
    * `make-autofill-meta`
    * `number-in-range`

* Document remaining forms from `congame/components/study`

    * `current-participant-identity-user?`
    * `current-participant-owner?`
    * `get-current-group-name`
    * `undefined`
    * `get/linked/instance`
    * `map-step`
    * `map-study`
    * `put-current-group-name`
    * `with-namespace`
    * `with-root`

## Basic concepts chapter

A chapter that walks through very basic concepts: defining variables, etc.
Something intended for more in-depth explanations of the kinds of simple things
the "Quick Tour" skims over.
