# Documentation tasks

Current priorities, in time/importance order:

## Multi-participant parent/child studies

A new tutorial written around a multi-participant study that uses parent/child
studies. This would provide an opportunity to test/improve how the newly added
matchmaking functions work in the presence of parent/child studies.

## Basic concepts chapter

A chapter that walks through very basic concepts: defining variables, etc.
Something intended for more in-depth explanations of the kinds of simple things
the "Quick Tour" skims over.

## Bots documentation

Precise contents/approach TBD

## Game theory/unit stuff

Precise contents/approach TBD
