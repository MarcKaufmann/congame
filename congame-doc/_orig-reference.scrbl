  section{Studies}

A @emph{study} is a series of @tech{steps} and a transition graph
that controls which steps transition to which steps.

@defproc[(study? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[v] is a study.
}

@defproc[(make-study [name string?]
                     [steps (listof step?)]
                     [#:requires requires (listof symbol?) null]
                     [#:provides provides (listof symbol?) null]
                     [#:transitions transitions (or/c #f (hash/c symbol? any/c)) #f]
                     [#:view-handler view-handler (or/c #f (-> request? response?)) #f]
                     [#:failure-handler failure-handler (or/c #f (-> step? any/c step-id/c)) #f]) study?]{

  Creates a @tech{study} that can be run by @racket[run-study]. The
  @racket[name] argument is used in debugging and in the admin interface. Any
  step that is part of the study has to be listed in @racket[steps].

  The @racket[#:transitions] argument has to be a @racket[transition-graph] that
  provides all the transitions between the steps. See @racket[transition-graph]
  for details.
}


@defproc[(run-study [s study?]
                    [req request? (current-request)]
                    [#:bindings bindings (hash/c symbol? any/c) (hasheq)]) any/c]{

  Runs the study @racket[s] under @racket[req] with @racket[bindings].
}

@section{Steps}

A @emph{step} is any page that can be used to relay information to
a participant or collect information from them (or both).

@defproc[(step? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[v] is a @tech{step}.
}

@defproc[(make-step [id symbol?]
                    [handler (-> step-page?)]
                    [transition transition/c (lambda () next)]
                    [#:view-handler view-handler (or/c #f (-> request? response?)) #f]
                    [#:for-bot bot-handler (or/c #f procedure?) #f]) step?]{

}

@defproc[(make-step/study [id symbol?]
                          [s study?]
                          [transition transition/c (lambda () next)]
                          [#:require-bindings require-bindings (listof binding/c) null]
                          [#:provide-bindings provide-bindings (listof binding/c) null]) step?]{

  Creates a @tech{step} that executes @racket[s] when reached.

  The @racket[#:require-bindings] argument maps identifiers required
  by @racket[s] to identifiers available in the current study context
  if the name is different -- otherwise it assumes that required
  identifers share names and attempts to set them
  accordingly.

  The @racket[#:provide-bindings] argument maps identifiers in the
  current study that should be mapped to some subset of the
  identifiers provided by @racket[s] upon completion.  When
  @racket[#:provide-bindings] is @racket[null?], no values are
  assigned.

  For example:

  @racketblock[
  (make-step/study
    'required-tasks
    task-study
    #:require-bindings '([n task-treatment])
    #:provide-bindings '([root-success? success?]))
  ]

  Here, @racket[n] in @racket[task-study] will take on the value of
  @racket[task-treatment], and after running, @racket[root-success?]
  will be assigned the value of @racket[success?] in the parent.
}

@defproc[(step-page? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[v] is a step page.
}

@defform[(page maybe-validator expr ...+)
         #:grammar
         [(maybe-validator (code:line)
                           (code:line #:validator validator-expr))]
         #:contracts
         [(validator-expr (-> any/c xexpr?))]]{

  Within a @tech{step}, @racket[page] ensures that the setup actions are not run
  again in case the page contains a form that is submitted and fails validation.
  Specifically, consider a page containing a form:

  For example:

  @codeblock|{
    (define (step-with-setup-and-form)
      (perform-a-once)
      (perform-b-once)
      (page
       (begin
         (perform-c-again)
         (haml
           (:h1 "The Form")
           ;; some form
           ;; ...
           ))))
  }|

  When the user lands on @racket[step-with-setup-and-form] the first time,
  resumes there, or refreshes the page, @racket[perform-a-once] and
  @racket[perform-b-once] will be called. If the user submits the form and it
  fails validation, the page will be reloaded showing the error messages and the
  fields filled with the inputs that were valid. However, neither
  @racket[perform-a-once] nor @racket[perform-b-once] will be run again, while
  @racket[perform-c-again] will be run again.

  It is possible to pass a custom validator for @racket[xexpr]s to @racket[page]
  to provide better error messages.
}

@deftogether[(
  @defthing[#:kind "canary" next any/c]
  @defthing[#:kind "canary" done any/c]
)]{
  Special values that can be used as transition results to cause a
  study to transition to the next step or to the end of the study,
  respectively.
}

@subsection{Step Widgets}

@defproc[(button [action (-> void?)]
                 [label xexpr?]
                 [#:id id string? ""]
                 [#:to-step-id to-step-id (or/c #f symbol?) #f]) xexpr?]{

  Renders a button with the given @racket[label] that executes
  @racket[action] when pressed.  After the @racket[action] is
  executed, moves the participant to the step named by
  @racket[to-step-id] or the next step if @racket[to-step-id] is
  @racket[#f].

  The @racket[#:id] argument is useful for identifying the button
  within @tech{bot handlers}.
}

@defproc[(form [f form?]
               [action (-> void?)]
               [render (-> (widget-renderer/c) xexpr?)]
               [#:id id string? ""]
               [#:enctype enctype string? "multipart/form-data"]) xexpr?]{

  Renders the form represented by @racket[f] using @racket[render] and
  executes @racket[action] on successful submission, then continues to
  the next step in the study.

  The @racket[#:id] argument is the same as for @racket[button].
}

@defproc[(skip [to-step-id symbol? #f]) void?]{
  Skips to the step named by @racket[to-step-id] or the next step in
  the study if @racket[to-step-id] is @racket[#f].
}

@section{Data Storage & Retrieval}

A @deftech{step scope} represents the region of the database where
data for a study is stored and retrieved from.  Step scope is
determined by the combination of the current participant, the study
stack and optional round and group information.  @deftech{Instance
scope} is shared between participants to a study @tech{instance}.

@defproc[(get [k symbol?]
              [default (or/c any/c (-> any/c)) (Î» () (error 'get "value not found for key ~.s" k))]
              [#:round round-name string? ""]
              [#:group group-name string? ""]) any/c]{

  Retrieves the value stored under the symbol @racket[k] for the
  current @tech{step scope}.  If no such value exists,
  @racket[default] is called if it is a procedure, or returned if it
  is a value.
}

@defproc[(get/instance [k symbol?]
                       [default (or/c any/c procedure?)]) any/c]{

  Like @racket[get], but retrieves data from @tech{instance scope}.
}

@defproc[(put [k symbol?]
              [v any/c]
              [#:round round-name string? ""]
              [#:group group-name string? ""]) void?]{

  Stores @racket[v] under the symbol @racket[k] for the current
  @tech{step scope}.
}

@defproc[(put/instance [k symbol?]
                       [v any/c]) void?]{

  Like @racket[put], but stores data in @tech{instance scope}.
}

@deftogether[(
  @defproc[(get-current-round-name) string?]
  @defproc[(put-current-round-name [round-name string?]) void?]
)]{
  Controls the current round for participants in a study.
}

@deftogether[(
  @defproc[(get-current-group-name) string?]
  @defproc[(put-current-group-name [group-name string?]) void?]
)]{
  Controls the current group for participants in a study.
}

@defmodule[congame/components/transition-graph]

@defform[(transition-graph transition-clause ...+)
         #:grammar
         [(transition-clause (code:line [id transition-entry ...+]))

          (transition-entry (code:line --> transition-target))

          (transition-target (code:line id)
                             (code:line (unquote transition-lambda)))

          (transition-lambda (code:line (lambda () transition-expr ...+))
                             (code:line (lambda name:id () transition-expr ...+)))

                           (code:line expr))]
         ]{

  A @racket[transition-graph] consists of one or more transition-entries. For
  example:

  @racketblock[
  (make-study
    "some study"
    #:transitions
    (transition-graph
      [a --> b --> ,(lambda ()
                      (if succes-step-b?
                        (goto bad-ending)
                        (goto good-ending)))]
      [fail-ending --> fail-ending]
      [good-ending --> good-ending])
    (list
      (make-step 'a a)
      (make-step 'b b)
      (make-step 'c c)))
  ]
}
