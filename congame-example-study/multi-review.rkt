;; FIXME: refactor submit+review-study once we have used it some -- there is
;; quite some duplication of code across the main and the admin studies,
;; suggesting it can be done better.

;; design:
;; * the entire class is part of the same group
;; * the size of the group is predeterimened (eg. 10 people total)
;; * first, everybody has to submit a submission before anybody can make progress
;; * everybody is assigned to review 2 other random people from the group
