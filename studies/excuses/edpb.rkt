;; TODO
;; - Add intro-completion-code to the instance level of edpb-intro and edpb-main (where people receive it if they continue with the study)
;; - Add information to the study and to the consent form that they need to signup with their prolific email to do the main study.
;; - Change the study so that people have to sign up right away, after providing just their prolific ID and their answer to the patience question (to see selection). That way, we don't need to merge any of the data across studies and I do not have to wait for Bogdan to implement anything. We should still implement talking between instances.
;; - create a prolific only signup page, i.e. people have to type in a prolific email or ID. This avoids them signing up with personal emails.
