      @:p{This study is conducted by Flora Drucker and Marc Kaufmann and financed by Central European University. Your participation is voluntary and if you accept to participate, you may withdraw at any time. However, please note that you will receive some bonuses if you complete specific parts of the study. This is described in more detail on the Instructions page.}

      @:p{Participation in this study is not associated with any foreseeable risk or benefit. Your answers will be collected confidentially and anonymously (the researchers will not be able to link decisions and participants' identity beyond the Prolific ID provided). At the data analysis stage your Prolific ID will be changed to a random identifying number, and the Prolific IDs will be deleted. In case the results of the study are published, there can be no references to your identity. Data anonymity is guaranteed.}

      @:p{This study received a research ethics approval from the Ethical Research Committee of Central European University.}
